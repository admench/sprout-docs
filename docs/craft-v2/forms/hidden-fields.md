# Hidden Fields

A [Hidden Field](../fields/hidden-field.md) and [Invisible Field](../fields/invisible-field.md) can both be found in Sprout Fields.

These two fields can help you manage a handful of front-end form use cases where you may need to capture a value that doesn't display or is not seen by your users. 

You can set each field to a specific value or, with the help of the `setFieldVariables` tag, the Hidden Field and the Invisible Field can be set to any value on your page.  A longer description of this functionality can be found in the Hidden Field documentation.
