# Subscriber Lists

A Subscriber List is the thing that subscribers will subscribe to. By default Sprout Lists provides a List Element Type but subscribers can subscribe to any Element Type that Craft supports (Entries, Categories, Users, Products, etc.)

Sprout Lists provides a default Subscriber List Type which allows you to add or remove Subscribers to a list within the Craft Control Panel and create relationships to existing Craft Users. Custom List Types can also be created using a [Custom List Type](./list-types.md) integration.
