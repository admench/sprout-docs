# About Sprout Lists

Sprout Lists allows you to create Subscriber Lists (or designate any Element as a Subscriber List). With Subscriber Lists, your users can:

- Subscribe and unsubscribe to things
- Follow or unfollow things
- Like or unlike things

::: tip
We will use the term **Subscribe** throughout the docs, but you can substitute in the terms **Like** or **Follow** as you prefer.
