# Assets

Import your assets using Craft's _Settings â†’ Update Asset Indexes_ tool.

For lots of assets, consider breaking them into more folders and raising the amount of memory available in the environment which you are importing them in.

Assets can be matched back to Elements in Asset Relations fields using the `related` key. See [Resolving Relationships](./resolve-relationships.md)
