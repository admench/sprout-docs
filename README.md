# Sprout Docs

See our website for the complete [Sprout Documentation](https://sprout.barrelstrengthdesign.com/docs/).

## Updating the docs

Sprout Documentation uses [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and the [VuePress theme for Craft CMS documentation](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/vuepress-theme-craftdocs). 

Documentation Markdown files are stored in the `/docs` folder 

Some useful commands while working with the docs:

| Command | Notes |
|:------- |:----- |
| yarn install | Get everything working |
| yarn docs:dev | Spins up a VuePress dev server so you can update Markdown and see those updates in real time in your browser (without generating a static site) |
- yarn docs:build | Generates static site (no need to run this if submitting pull requests, this is handled during deployment) |
